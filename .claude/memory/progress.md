This folder stores short human-maintained notes and decisions that Claude can read to get project history.
Do not store sensitive tokens here.

Usage examples:

- memory/decision-db.md — why we chose Postgres over Mongo
- memory/prompt-tweaks.md — experiments with temperature and system messages
- memory/test-cases.md — manual test cases for acceptance criteria

Keep each file short (max 400–800 words). Claude will use these as long-term context.
